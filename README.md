Little Island is a game about building a life on a remote island.

## Thank you!

These people have been vital in the making of this game:

- [Dylan](https://github.com/dylanopen) - programming, assets, project management
- [RyiSnow](https://youtube.com/@RyiSnow) - temporary player sprites, inspiration
  - Message to RyiSnow - I will not use your assets when the game is released outside of beta!
  - The assets are used as placeholders which will be replaced in a future update.
